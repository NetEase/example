The purpose of this repository is to provide a basic working skeleton featuring:
    - Maven building and dependency resolution
    - git SCM support
    - Maven release management (scm tagging builds)

Items to do:
    - Add dependencies to depot
    - Ideally have a structure like: my-app-1.1.zip, my-app-1.1-sources.zip, my-app-1.1-javadoc.zip
    - Automated CHANGELOG
